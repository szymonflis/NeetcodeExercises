# 🧠 Neetcode Exercises

Welcome to **Neetcode Exercises** — a collection of coding challenges and problem solutions inspired by [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) (similar to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)).  
This repository serves as my personal space to **practice**, **learn**, and **grow** as I continue to upskill and strengthen my algorithmic problem-solving abilities.

## 🚀 About This Repository

Each folder or file in this repository represents a **Neetcode problem** that I’ve solved while improving my coding skills.  
The exercises cover a range of computer science concepts, including:

- 🧩 **Data Structures** – Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Heaps
- ⚙️ **Algorithms** – Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming
- 🧮 **Mathematical Logic** – Bit Manipulation, Combinatorics, and more
- 💡 **Systematic Thinking** – Problem breakdowns and optimized solutions

My goal is not just to collect solutions — but to **document thought processes**, **optimize code**, and **track progress** over time.
