Insertion Sort
Solved 
Implement Insertion Sort and return intermediate states.

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time, from left to right. It works by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted portion and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion of the list.

Objective:

Given a list of key-value pairs, sort the list by key using Insertion Sort. Return a list of lists showing the state of the array after each insertion. If two key-value pairs have the same key, maintain their relative order in the sorted list.

Input:

pairs - a list of key-value pairs, where each key-value has an integer key and a string value. (0 <= pairs.length <= 100).
Example 1:

Input:
pairs = [(5, "apple"), (2, "banana"), (9, "cherry")]

Output:
[[(5, "apple"), (2, "banana"), (9, "cherry")], 
 [(2, "banana"), (5, "apple"), (9, "cherry")], 
 [(2, "banana"), (5, "apple"), (9, "cherry")]]
Notice that the output shows the state of the array after each insertion. The last state is the final sorted array. There should be pairs.length states in total.

Example 2:

Input:
pairs = [(3, "cat"), (3, "bird"), (2, "dog")]

Output:
[[(3, "cat"), (3, "bird"), (2, "dog")], 
 [(3, "cat"), (3, "bird"), (2, "dog")],
 [(2, "dog"), (3, "cat"), (3, "bird")]]
In this example, you can observe that the pairs with key=3 ("cat" and "bird") maintain their relative order, illustrating the stability of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
